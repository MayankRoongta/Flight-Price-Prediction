# Flight-Price-Prediction
The use of our machine learning model to predict the fares of air transport will help in a
significant way to large number of people as they can then travel by air mode at a cheap price.
The model that consists of the estimation of the fare along with an User Interface to show the
results can assist the people in selecting the correct date and time to book the ticket as well as
the destination if it is not pre decided. Hence Overall this concept to predict the estimated
airfare will in a way increase the air passengers significantly and save them a lot of time

This project aims to study the factors that influence airfare prices. Then using this
information, build a system that can predict the price of the air ticket that will help the buyer
whether to buy it or not. Considering the features such as departure time, arrival time,
duration of the flight, journey day, and the total number of stops along with Machine
Learning techniques can help in predicting the price of an air ticket.
